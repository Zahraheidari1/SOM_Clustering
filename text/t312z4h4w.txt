Is putting cocaine in your eyeballs normal ?
I want to lead this by saying I’ve seen and heard a lot of stuff in my day , however this topic has left me stunned. 

A friend of mine told me that this passed weekend she witnessed an acquaintance dab cocaine into his eyeballs as if he were dabbing it onto gums.  I’m completely flabbergasted as to why anyone would do this. 

In all my years of experience I’ve never heard of such a thing , not even from a the junkiest of junkie I’ve come into contact with over the years.

Has anyone ever heard of this ? I  tried to do some research but there wasn’t anything I could find on the topic.

ETA: 

I wanted to also note that when I asked my friend how the rest of the group responded she did say that they weren’t that phased, which means he has done this around them before. When my friend asked why this man had done that , he quickly threw out a distraction to nonchalantly divert the attention off his bizarre actions. 

The craziest thing is , he’s a hard working likable guy who’s a pretty decent bartender and is well received at our local bar. I will never look at this man the same again.
