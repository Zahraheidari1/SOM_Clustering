Best trip of my life
The last 7ish times I’ve tripped, it’s been hella underwhelming. I’m 5’8, female, and weigh around 175 lbs. I usually take one tab of acid when I trip, but I decided to get two since I weigh a good 30 lbs more than my husband. I popped two gel tabs around 8 in the morning yesterday and put on flushed away (kids movies are hilarious tripping) and then turbo. At some point reality started looking like an ai generated video, everything moving and turning into different shapes and patterns. We watched a lot of movies, and then decided to hit a delta 11 cart for a couple minutes straight until we couldn’t even keep our eyes focused. My mom decided to take us out on a road trip to get food, and we had margaritas at a restaurant after a long drive of staring out the window in awe of nature. I remember looking at my own hands and thinking “every person to ever exist has shared a moment like this. We all have bodies, and hands, that we grow with until we die.” I felt connected to every human that’s ever existed. Safe to say I have a way deeper connection with my husband now (even though it was already extremely strong) and I have a newfound appreciation for nature and my own body &lt; 3
