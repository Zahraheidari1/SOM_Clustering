Capitalism vs Communism debate: Maupin v. Russell
It is almost funny to watch these two guys be in such "violent agreement" that they fail to understand that they're "taking sides" about exactly the same thing.  

Russell says corruption arises because government kisses corporate butts -- therefore there should be no government.

Maupin says corruption arises because corporations dominate government.  He doesn't go as far as to say there should be no corporations.

The real debate they are having is **whether or not there should be a government at all.**

That question has to be answered *first* before the type of government can be debated.

Russell fails to make his case against any government.  

Maupin insists that government must manage the capitalists for the benefit of all citizens.

Russell ignores China's success for the last 40 years as it navigates that treacherous line between a centrally planned economy and an incentive (capitalist) economy.

The point isn't whether or not Maupin presents the right interpretation of Marx, but that he completely disembowels Russell's libertarianism.
