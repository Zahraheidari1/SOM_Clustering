Stimulants &amp; Epilepsy
Right so before anyone comments, yes I know stimulants can cause trigger epileptic seizures for a variety of reasons, however epilepsy has a multitude of triggers which can vary depending on the person, one of which being tiredness. (No I do not mean sleep deprivation, stimulants will cause seizures triggered by deprivation.)

So if someone was diagnosed with epilepsy and the main cause of their seizures was fatigue and feeling tired, hypothetically taking something to wake you up and feel less fatigued would decrease the risk of seizures. For example let’s say I have epilepsy caused by tiredness, and when I feel really fatigued I take a bomb of amphetamine, would the drug do the opposite of what is expected and instead prevent seizures?

Now I understand other factors trigger epileptic seizures, and if stimulants cause some of these triggers, taking them will have negative effects still. However like me, if someone has seizures mostly, if not only caused by fatigue, stimulants would reduce my chances of a seizure as long as I used the drug responsibly and knew it didn’t cause me seizures or conflict with medication. I myself take Amphetamine and have found staying awake even for days does not trigger my seizures. If however I take Amphetamine, then don’t sleep or take more upon it wearing off, I will, because I’m beginning to feel fatigued. 

Fyi, I do not recommend anyone takes stimulants as a permanent medicine for epilepsy, I’m just trying to show that stimulants aren’t an immediate danger that cause severe seizures or even death.
