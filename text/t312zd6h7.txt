Is there a drug that I can take regularly to feel good without impacting my job?
Basically the title. Is there any drug I can use regularly after work that won't fuck me up for the following day at work. 

I have an extremely lucrative career that is at risk because I am addicted to alcohol and benzos (which often fuck me up in the morning). But working is dogshit and makes things unenjoyable after work unless I abuse substances which I know are harming my long-term health.

Is there anything that fits the description or am I searching for a White whale here?

Thanks for any assistance.
