232 days clean and sober 🤙🏼
Today I am nearly 8 months clean and sober and just want to let you all know that it is indeed possible! 

I never believed that I would truly find a happiness in life without being on some sort of drug. And I was no rookie, nor did I discriminate when it came to my drug use. I preferred oxy, heroin, fentanyl. But I also often used meth, coke, and I had a deep love for Xanax. 

There is a life worth living out there without the shit.

I used for 10+ years, while I was in college, after I graduated, while I was living what everyone around me thought was a normal life. Eventually everything you hide will come to light.

I’ve watched too many people I know and love overdose, and die. The high is not worth the risk!
