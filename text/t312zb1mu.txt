I’m sick of this shit
Yes, I’m sick of big Pharma, I’m sick of those doctor that prescribe benzos so easily. Do they even realise how powerful this drug is. Do they even tell there patient how dangerous it can be. Do they tell the parents of the child they prescribe this shit too how dangerous it is? 

Looks like they just want to sell more and more and don’t really care about the well being of there patient.

Or maybe they don’t even know how dangerous this shit is. They went to college, they studied for years but they prescribe benzos like it’s fucking candy.

They prescribe it to your child, your parents, and your grandparents without exception. They ruin life on a daily by trying to make it better for what? 1 hour… 1 month maybe, when you’ll fell good and anxiety free. 

Is it worth it? Shouldn’t people try to live with their anxiety instead of risking their life just to feel comfortable around people. (I gotta say I have anxiety around big crowds but I’d rather deal with it than risking to get addicted to this shit for the rest of my life)

I’m mad, here’s my rant.
