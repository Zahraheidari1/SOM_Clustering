Help me with mah pain
So I got 9 teeth extracted and since NA is donkey nuts with handing out RX all I got was 5mg percocet, and they gave me 5 of them............... I'm also trying to get a high since I'm bored af and in pain wanna ask the experts here what order and Timeline I could take these substance I have available,  two 5mg percocet, 20mg baclofen,  800 mg gabapentin, and the last one will probably be shunned but 2mg/ml bromazolam..... My plan was eat meal with 400mg gabapentin wait 30 min than snack eat other half wait and hour or more take 5mg percocet,  and 20-30mg baclofen. Idk about the benzo solution maybe after a few hours just to chill.  Does my plan sound efficient any upgrades available ðŸ¤”
