Is it just me or do drug rappers not talk about drugs breaking their dick often enough?
I was listening to some lil soda boi today and the[ song cus im stuntin](https://youtu.be/clvqSx5jlNk) came on.  Part of the hook goes, "Dick so big bitch thought it was a dildo.  Couldn't get it up cause I was off a couple pills though," and I just find that shit so refreshing to hear.

Like every one of these rappers claims to take inhuman amounts of drugs and then have a world class dick game on top of it?  Nah, I'm not buying it.  These dudes are fucking lying!

I know I'm forgetting at least a song or two*, but right now off the top of my head the only examples I can even think of of rappers actually talking about drugs impacting their fuck ability is this song and Chief Keef had a few of em back in the day.  Also Capo too iirc.

Idk.  Anyone else feel this way?  Lmao

*I know Fat Nick and Slug Christ both do have tracks where they talk about being unable to cum because they're on too many opiates.  I feel like that's a bit different though?  A related issue with the same cause and again most rappers won't say some shit like that, but I do feel like it's not quite the same also because like just not being able to cum isn't really as embarrassing, y'know?  Like I'm talking dudes who say some shit like, "I don't wanna fuck bitch, my dick out of order." (From Chief Keef's verse from the Capo song Now.)  Like just fully owning it and essentially saying I don't care if ny dick doesn't work anymore, getting high is my priority!
