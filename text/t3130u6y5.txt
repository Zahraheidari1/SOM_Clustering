Safe substance use for a festival
Hi everyone, I am attending a festival this year and I'm starting to plan my substances. I'd like to know your thoughts about my plan. 

Note, I never overdo substances so this is already a big stretch for me:

D1: 80 mg - 6-apb // 15/20 mg amphtamine for the comedown

D2: 20mg amphetamine (// maybe 2 hours later again 20mg amphetamine)

D3: nothing

Do you think I'II be fine or will I experience a comedown the third day?

Idk if I should drop again amphetamine the third day or not. I have the feeling I'm already overdoing on amphetamine. I'm not really confortable doing psychedelics or any other type of drug in that setting.

I also have some 3-mmc available, maybe I should replace the amphetamine with 3-mmc the second day? 

Or maybe do 2c-b with some amphetamine (since Iâ€™m low dosages, 2c-b is manageable)?

Btw: l'Il have some hydration tabs to put in my drink and get myself hydrated. I won't drink alcohol.

Do you think I should supplement amphetamine with 5-htp? Or even with acetyl-L-carnitine?

I'd like to hear your thoughts.
