Dialetics?
A few years back i was at a local college. I worked at the library part time. They were clearing out all the old paperbacks they had and where selling them for a quarter or two.  


I found a book about dialectics. Now from what i remember i dont think it was explicitly dialectical materialism (or marxist in) just about dialectics. Now i tried to read the book several times but the feeling i got reading it was trying to read Zizek or Derrida, sheer eye rolling rage. What i did understand of it could have been more plainly stated.  


Long story short i introduced the book to the cracked eggs in the trash can. I have always been fairly familiar with dialectical materialism. I went through a History degree so historical materialism was straightforward to understand. i went from there on to david harvey's books. i read through the first half of capital volume 1.   


i have found a few intros to dialectical materialism. I got a copy of Luna oi's book about it. Ill be going through it soon.

I wanted to ask if anyone else have found a book about dialectics like that. I wanted to take a crack at reading it again. I dont have a title and googling hasnt help me out so far. I just wanted to see anyone could recommend anything.
