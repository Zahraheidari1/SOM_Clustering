Just wondering how selfish or selfless we are intrinsically.
If you had a choice between getting your deepest desire/wish/accomplishment/goal or ending poverty,inequality,homelessness,and food insecurity, which would you choose?

Iâ€™m just curious to see if the means of production and modes of production are in the hands of the working class, would things be any different or would the working class become the new bourgeoisie as it was the case with mercantilists becoming the middle class.
