Anyone else experience this in psychosis
My mind was convincing me that a person I knew was someone else pretending to be them. Well cloned basically that was very disturbing it took abit for me to be in control of my thoughts and I was hearing his voice in my head. I still do. It was so hard cause I was so in love and heart broken. So many fucked delusions I’ve had 

My mind was making me think he put something in my head and he can hear my thoughts and see my every move for abit it was a battle not letting it all take over me completely and let my mind completely get taken away. Some of it has though.
It feels weird, like I’m being watching 24/7
