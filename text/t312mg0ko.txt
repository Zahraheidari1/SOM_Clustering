What is to be done
So I I've been looking through a bunch of different Lenin works to see what I want to read. So I happened upon what is to be done. And since it is such an important work in lenins journey. I'm wondering is it worth reading. How relevent is it to modern day. I'll probably read it anyway but just wondering.
