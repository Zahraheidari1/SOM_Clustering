somked weed yesterday and everything feels changed
Yesterday morning I took some hits from my vape pen, I got really really high and my entire life felt like a TV show. Later that day I smoked once again. Me and my friend tried to smoke as much as possible and I smoked myself to sobriety. I don't think I actually got sober but it felt like it. Ever since then I have had this extreme anxiety and it feels like something bad is going to happen. It also feels like something has changed or something like the entire world just feels diffrent.
