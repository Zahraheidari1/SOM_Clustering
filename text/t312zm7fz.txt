Fidel, Latin America, and the role of Religious Practice
Greetings comrades! I am looking for resources (especially academic/researched ones) on Castro’s relationship to religious practice/community. General work on religion in Latin Am would be welcome, as well. 

I have admired many of Castro’s direct references and allusions to Christianity (eg his great quote about Jesus choosing the proletariate; his frequent invocation of “ethics” and “morality” in his anti-capitalist speeches), but was looking for more historical context. Thanks for any help or recommendations!
