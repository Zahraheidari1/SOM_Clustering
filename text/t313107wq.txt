I love drugs but let's be honest...
Please be aware that it is irresponsible to say "everyone" should do x drug. LSD, mushrooms and pot have all bettered my life greatly. However, approximately 1 percent of the population is at risk of getting psychosis from drugs like pot and acid. Please be aware that drugs are very powerful and can ruin someone's mental health.
