Chile Nationalizes Lithium. Do Marxists support this?
[I guess I'm getting around the prohibition of cross posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/12u4e8o/chile_plans_to_nationalize_its_vast_lithium/)

But as I see it, this is a concrete step toward the goal Marx has defined.  I'm curious whether or not this sub sees it that way.
