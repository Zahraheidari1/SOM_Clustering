Is it normal to take Xanax and alcohol for clubbing?
My girlfriend is on holiday in Europe and her cousin gave her Xanax, and they obviously drank, for a night out clubbing. As far as I know it just makes you drowsy and have no idea what you're doing and fall asleep and forget everything, not great for partying. I don't know why he did that and am feeling shady about it.

I should note he's a pharmacist and drug dealer and supposedly has access to anything, although he did have to fly to Spain from UK so maybe that's all he had.
