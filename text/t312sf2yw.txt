“M” was right about everything.
This isn’t related to theory, but I need to say this…

My former classmate from my freshman year of college was an *ardent* Marxist. Not the sort that parrots the postmodern jambalaya and calls it a criticism of capitalism, nor the kind that reads a quote by Che Guevara and considers herself a socialist. She read *everything* about Marx. 

At first, I dismissed it out of hand and brushed her off. I even made an impassioned defense of Ray Dalio and, somehow, got a response of patience. My god, was I wrong. If there is one thing I have learned from the pandemic, it is that “M” was right about EVERYTHING. Marx was truly ahead of his time. Technical as it may be, the labor theory of value is a far better explanation than anything the capitalists have come up with. And the materialist conception of history absolutely crushes the Ubermensch. 

If you’re reading this, thank you for changing my mind. (To each according to their ability, I suppose.). Hopefully you end up bringing back Marxism to the forefront of discussion.
