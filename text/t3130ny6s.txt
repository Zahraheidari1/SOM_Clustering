Male… enhancement advice
I have a date tonight that could very well lead to sex and I just got took a pretty heavy dose of phenibut which (sometimes) has a negative effect on sex drive or my ability to maintain an erection. I’ve only experienced these negative side effects alone while masturbating… maybe I won’t experience them when having full on sex but I’d rather not take the risk and I’m thinking of trying those ‘rhino’ male enhancement pills or whatever. Anyone ever try them? How’d they work?
