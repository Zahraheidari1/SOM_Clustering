Future of Marxism?
 I have a few questions related to the future of Marxism:

**1.** In the event that predictions about AI and robots replacing human workers in the near or distant future come true, regardless of whether such a future is utopian or dystopian, what can Marxism offer to such a society?

In other words, in a society where there are no workers, there will be no working class. What happens to Marxism (socialism, communism) in such a scenario? Does it still serve a purpose, and if so, how?

An example of such a society is capitalism, in which scientific and technological advancements have led to the rejection of the need to employ workers. Instead of earning a living through work, people have a Universal Basic Income (UBI) that allows them to live well, with access to adequate food, housing, and the like. They engage in art, hobbies, and other non-productive and non-service sectors. Those who require additional wealth, money, power, etc. primarily do so through trade - in such a society, the only people who work are essentially capitalists.

(I'm not primarily interested in discussing whether the above or any other utopia (or dystopia) is possible, but what happens to Marxism?)

**2.** Is it even necessary for AI and robots to physically replace workers - when a society establishes a UBI, does this mean that the working class ceases to exist from that point on?

**3.** Do Marxists/leftists/communists and other left-leaning options oppose 1 and 2, and if so, why?
