Prolekult's new film asks the most pressing questions for our movement in our time.
Yo comrades!

Has anyone seen Prolekult's new film 'Orthodoxy and Revisionism', from their Approaching Marxism series? The film looks at the original revisionist controversy in the German SPD as a way to interrogate whether there is a need for a revolutionary orthodoxy right now. This really feels, to me, like an important intervention and a key tension that our tradition faces at the moment. They've also produced a free group study guide (on their Patreon) with suggested reading and a few items for reflection and discussion. The guide asks a few questions, they are:

\- What are the distinctions between Kautsky and Bernstein's positions and why? And why they matter?

\- What is the social basis for the revisionist controversy internationally, in Germany and the SPD?

\- To provide an overview of Luxembourg &amp; Lenin's critique of Kautsky and apply this to the contemporary left now.

I'm interested to know what others think. It feels of great significance and relevancy.

Link to the vid is in the reply.
