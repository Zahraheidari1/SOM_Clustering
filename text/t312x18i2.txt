The Great Leap Forward
Was Mao’s plan accelerationist, and were the millions of deaths a result (in theory) of too rapidly developing the Chinese economy?  Of course there were other problems like false reporting on productivity, etc., but what was the theory behind it?  I know little about Mao, and I would prefer to read more information about it rather than “10000 Trillion Deaths.”
