Do you ever get so high your body is uncomfortable?
I smoked a fair amount of weed and i’m really high now. 

My knees feel hot and weird now, plus they were already hurting from a long day of work. It’s just so much worse now, plus the ringing in my ears. 

Being high just makes my pains so much more present.
