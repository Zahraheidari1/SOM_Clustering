Vyvanse for taking an exam?
Im taking the equivalent of a american bar exam for my country this sunday. I was taking Ritalin for studying and a friend gave me 3 Vyvanse capsules. And oh god, this is so much better for studying than Ritalin. I saved 2, one for friday and one for the day of the exam.

But i’ll be honest and say that i’m not very prepared for the exam, and i’m already having anxiety about having anxiety at the day of the exam because of this. I’m not sure if taking a stimulant is the best idea because of this.

My questions are, have you ever took vyvanse for exams/tests? did it help? did you feel anxious because of the stimulus of the drug?
