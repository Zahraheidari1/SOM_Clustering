The Fundamental Problem With Revisionism?
I was hoping to have this be a sort of question/place of discussion. I am a socialist, heavily inspired by Marx. Whether I would be classified as a Marxist is something I am somewhat unsure of and accept would likely be up to one's definition of the word Marxist. As I said, I see Marx (and many of his later followers such) as some of the greatest social scientists and economists of our era, but, due to the fact I have some points where I disagree with him, and due to the ambiguity of the term, generally just opt to call myself a socialist. 

All that out of the way, I was hoping to learn a bit more about why most Marxists I have seen are so opposed to revisionism, as a concept. Though I have seen arguments over whether certain thinkers and leaders were revisionist or not, I have nearly always seen these discussions based on the assumption that revisionism is fundamentally a negative. Based on my understanding of Marx, he was heavily opposed to religious orthodoxy, and the sort of domination of certain interpretations as the sole 'truth' above all others. Additionally, I have often seen Marxism touted as a living science, a fact I think is very much in its favorite. As monumental of a thinker as Marx was, he did live in the 1800s and, naturally, in order to continue his legacy, Marxism must be willing to adapt to the conditions of time and place. In view of these things, why then, is 'revision' of potentially outdated or overlooked aspects in orthodox Marxist thought fundamentally bad? Shouldn't Marxism opt to revise itself so as to best suit the everchanging needs and conditions of the working class? I fully accept I may be operating on a different definition of revisionism than most Marxists, or that not all (or even most) Marxists are anti-revisionist, or that I perhaps made some other fundamental error, but am asking this question in genuine good faith and curiosity, and in the hopes of productive discussion.
