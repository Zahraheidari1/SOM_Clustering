What i hate the most about sobriety...
I really fucking miss those little escapes from reality. I miss drinking too much alcohol and smoking a pack of cigs at a time... just letting go of it all. Right now im having a shitty day, listening to "Black Hole Sun" by Kurt Cobain to feel better. (AI is getting creepy realistic)


And all I wanna do is sit on my porch, maybe silently weep to myself a bit with a pack of cigs and a bottle of Wild Turkey.


But I won't allow myself to relapse. I've made too much progress just to fuck it all up because of one bad day.
