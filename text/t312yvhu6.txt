Younger brother confided in me about wanting to try smoking weed.. what do I do
My younger brother (14yo) told me he wants to try smoking weed. He’s always been one to say he’d never touch anything because of what he’s seen happen to other family members. 
His friends have all done it and from what he’s said, they’ve told him that he “needs” to try it. They’ve told him all sorts like “it makes you feel third person” and “food tastes amazing”.
I’ve been there, done that, and don’t smoke anymore for my own reasons. Therefore I’m a hypocrite to say that he shouldn’t ever do it cuz it’s bad. I’ve tried to tell him about what realistically could happen but I know what its like to be that age, and its all so exciting, the advice is going in one ear, out the other. 
So I’m looking for advice on how to approach this. I’ve told him his secret is safe with me, because he doesn’t want mum to know. And I’ve told him I’d be there if it all went tits up. 
But at the same time I don’t want him to get sucked into the scene like I did, but peer pressure and curiosity is gonna make it inevitable.. rather than him find out for himself, what advice can I give him now? 

In short: brother wants to try smoking weed, from peer pressure and his own curiosity. How do I talk to him like his sister looking out for him, and not make him wanna hide things from me in the future?

TIA
