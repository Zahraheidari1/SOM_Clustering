Good drug for video games?
Looking for advice on which drug will best suit my purpose. An extended group of friends are hosting a LAN party at a buddy of mines in a few weeks, and I am looking for something to keep me awake but preferably not weaken me cognitively. I like to smoke weed and play games but I definitely find I'm slower when playing FPS games.

Was considering a low dose of LSD (70ug) but don't want to risk getting side tracked from actually participating in games. I'm thinking Adderall will probably be the best choice (don't typically use), what do you guys think?

Edit: 70ug not 70mg lol "low dose"
