2023 summer camp
Sun, summer, theory! Several parallel workshops will be offered twice a day at relaxed times; during the longer break there will be time to use in various ways: partying, lounging around, playing, sleeping and meeting lots of new people.

The camp is worthwhile firstly for people who want to discuss current political developments in depth, e.g.: War in Ukraine, feminist foreign policy, sanctions policy, right-wing government in Italy, inflation - impoverishment - financial crisis.
Second, the camp is worthwhile for those who want to get an introduction to radical left theory: e.g. critique of capitalism, freedom as a fundamental right, critique of education, humanities, natural sciences, critique of ideology, climate politics.

Third, there are a number of other topics that you might have always been interested in: e.g., classism, German nationalism in its songs, memory culture and nationalism in Germany, Bitcoin.
Fourth, some workshops will also be offered in English every time and you will have the opportunity to discuss some topics with people from the UK. So if you know people who don't know German well or not at all, but can manage English reasonably well, then promote the camp there.

Please check our website regularly, we will announce new workshops here.
