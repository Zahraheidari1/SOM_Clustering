Did I fry myself, thoughts?
I’m going to try to make this as short as I can but it may not be. 

History: from the age of 13-16 I went through a very heavy smoking (weed) phase. Almost every day starting at 14. Flower, dabs, whatever. 

I also went through a fairly heavy acid phase for such a young kid at 15. A 6-8 month period where I was tripping fairly often. Never tested my stuff but it felt pretty real so it’s safe to assume it was acid. I’ve also experimented with many prescription drugs but in small amounts on very few occasions.

Then I went though a heavy drinking phase for a year, then almost daily drinking for another year. I wanna say this was from age 16 or 17- to 18

I am now 21 and I don’t do anything besides drink very rarely and take my prescription medications: hydroxyzine, and Xanax. I take the Xanax very responsibly and only when desperately needed. 

Now I want to say I noticed this for the past 3 years but it got more noticeable when I stopped drinking.

Current symptoms: brain fog, stuttering, general feeling of a dumbass, some memory issues, derealization (fairly minor), wanting to be alone, feeling akward, anxiety, panic, just not knowing what words to say when talking to people, I’ve gotten quiet. I get these odd mood swings, chronic fatigue. And more.

I used to have alottt of friends but I stopped talking to them. Kind of stopped getting pleasure in things I used to like.  It’s kind of sad.

Also, I am not and was never depressed. I did a lot of drugs because I was a dumbass and they were fun. I’m not sure what happened…


Tltr: may have permafired myself from extensive teenage drug use :(

If anyone has experience or even better experience in treating this please leave a comment!
