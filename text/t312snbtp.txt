What is the most absurd subject on which you have heard someone doing a Marxist analysis?
and yet it was so interesting that the only ‘absurd’ was no one putting attention on it? I think a lot of things can be analyzed using marxism, so it could sound surprising at first but, marxism being applied to unusual things like ChatGPT, combustion engines or fungi kingdom? That’s ultra interesting

In fact, did you ever heard about a marxist analysis on the famous anime Attack On Titan?

I hope this won’t be taken as a joke or a troll post. I’m genuinely asking. I even remember someone asking, months ago, if there was a marxist view on astronomy, but I can’t find the post anymore. As for me, I think I’m the one that used marxism to analyze something ‘absurd’ which is religion. I started my bachelor’s thesis describing how the fact that hebrews were poor molded judaism (I’m sephardic, so I just didn't talk about it toughtlessly) while in mesoamerica the abundance of natural resources did something different.

Well, just that :)
