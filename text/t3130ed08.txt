How do you have fun without drugs?
I’m having a really hard time enjoying my sober life currently. There’s not even anything wrong. It’s just like I literally can’t go to a club or party or even be around a group of new people if I’m not fucked up and it makes me feel like such a drag to say that out loud.

 When I’m on coke or Molly for example I have an absolute fucking amazing time doing basically anything as I’m sure everyone here understands. I get extremely social. I enjoy going out to clubs and being around people and not just sitting around inside smoking weed and watching movies.

When I’m sober I literally just want to sit around. Smoke some weed. Watch some tv. Generally pretty boring shit. I’m generally very quiet and to myself which I hate and I’m trying so hard to snap out of.

I want to get myself to a place where I can have just as much fun Sober as I do when I’m completely fucked up… I want to have the same confidence. I want to be able to have the same “live in the moment and have fun” mentality that LSD and MDMA give me. How does one accomplish this??? 💔
