Criticisms of Marxism-Humanism
Hello,

I am interested in reading some criticisms of Marxism-Humanism, a distinct tendency within Marxism. I am especially interested in reading critiques of Raya Dunayevskaya, Andrew Kliman, and the Marxism-Humanist Initiative. 

Does anyone have any information which they'd like to share? Perhaps some articles, or papers or books?

It can be from Stalinists, Trots, Maoists, Anarchists, etc. Open to reading everything.
