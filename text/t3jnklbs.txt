mods here. yeah hi we exist. anyway we're going to temporarily restrict certain kinds of posts as an experiment to see if the subreddit's quality improves - full list below
so first, the rationale behind this. there are no good places to have slow-paced, high-quality discussions anymore. the other subreddits are kinda hyperkinetic, rapidly-cycling places either dominated by memes or news headlines. which is okay. they serve a purpose. but we'd like to carve out a niche for r/marxism and see if we can turn it into a refreshing space for people to have meaningful, deep conversations about stuff. that's difficult to do so right now we're just going to test taking away your free speech. we're going to start removing anything that fits into these categories and suggesting you take them to other subreddits:

1. Image-posts - try r/fullcommunism or genzedong 
2. Link-only posts - try one of the bigger subreddits 
3. Promoting your youtube channel or discord server 
4. 101 posts - try r/communism101. we're going to be conservative about what constitutes 101 and we'll only remove the most basic of the basic stuff. for instance if you have a q about the transformation problem, here is okay

if you'd like to post a link, we ask that you either do some commentary on it in the format of a text post, or pose 3-4 interesting questions related to the subject matter to prompt discussion. 

also there will be a minimum character limit for all posts and comments from now on - at the moment it's arbitrarily set to 120 for posts and 120 for comments.

otherwise we'll be importing the same rules more or less from r/communism, except a bit laxer, less severe, with comment removals instead of bans, and explanatory temp bans issued over perma bans in almost all cases.

i think that's about it. im opening this thread up for suggestions on what might be done to make this subreddit more discussion-oriented &amp; cultivate a community.
