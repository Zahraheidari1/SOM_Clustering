Why is there such hostility towards Leninists in Lib Left spaces? (excluding anarchists y'all are sweet :-)
l understand we as a collective have made many mistakes and though heavily exaggerated, cost many lives. But why are we treated with such hostility in Trotskyist spaces, especially when we are the vast majority of active Marxists? 

Another thing I hadn't gotten a proper answer before, even though most Marxist-Leninists agree with the basic idea of permanent revolution treated like imbeciles, and not even given the decency of being talked to in the way the rest of us Marxists discuss theory? What happened to Trotsky was 80 years ago and everybody involved is long dead, why must we be humiliated by who we assume are still under the banner of the proletariat alongside us? 

Stalinism is no more, why can we not speaks civilly and with mutual respect?
