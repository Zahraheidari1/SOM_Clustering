Official Weekly Free-For-All Thread
#Welcome to another edition of the weekly free for all!

For any newcomers, this is a thread where you're allowed to have friendly conversations about anything (within boundary). The idea is to give fellow drugitors a chance to talk about other things within the community (which would normally be deemed irrelevant/unsuitable to the subreddit).

#What would you like to talk about? Just post it!
